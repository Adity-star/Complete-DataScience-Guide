### Discrete Probability Distributions
#### Bernoulli Distribution
* The **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable that has exactly two possible outcomes, usually labeled as success and failure. It is a special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is one.
  
* **Key Characteristics** of the Bernoulli Distribution:
  - Two outcomes: Typically represented as 1 (success) and 0 (failure).
  - **Parameter** \( p \): The probability of success (i.e., \( P(X=1) = p \)).
  - The probability of failure is \( 1 - p \) (i.e., \( P(X=0) = 1 - p \)).

* **Formula**:
  - Probability mass function (PMF):
    \[
    P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1-x}
    \]
    where \( x \in \{0, 1\} \).
  
* **Example**:
  - A coin toss: Heads = 1 (success), Tails = 0 (failure), with \( p = 0.5 \) for a fair coin.

* **Properties**:
  - **Mean** (Expected Value): \( \mu = p \)
  - **Variance**: \( \sigma^2 = p(1 - p) \)
