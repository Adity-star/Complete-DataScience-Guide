### Discrete Probability Distributions
#### [Bernoulli Distribution](#bernoulli-distribution)
* The **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable that has exactly two possible outcomes, usually labeled as success and failure. It is a special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is one.
  
* **Key Characteristics** of the Bernoulli Distribution:
  - Two outcomes: Typically represented as 1 (success) and 0 (failure).
  - **Parameter** \( p \): The probability of success (i.e., \( P(X=1) = p \)).
  - The probability of failure is \( 1 - p \) (i.e., \( P(X=0) = 1 - p \)).

* **Formula**:
  - Probability mass function (PMF):
    \[
    P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1-x}
    \]
    where \( x \in \{0, 1\} \).
  
* **Example**:
  - A coin toss: Heads = 1 (success), Tails = 0 (failure), with \( p = 0.5 \) for a fair coin.

* **Properties**:
  - **Mean** (Expected Value): \( \mu = p \)
  - **Variance**: \( \sigma^2 = p(1 - p) \)

#### [Binomial Distribution](#binomial-distribution)
* The **Binomial distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. It generalizes the Bernoulli distribution (which models a single trial) to multiple trials.

* **Key Characteristics** of the Binomial Distribution:
  - **Number of trials**: There are \( n \) independent trials (experiments).
  - **Probability of success**: The probability of success on each trial is \( p \), and the probability of failure is \( 1 - p \).
  - **Number of successes**: The random variable \( X \) represents the number of successes (or the count of successful outcomes) in the \( n \) trials.

* **Formula**:
  - Probability mass function (PMF):
    \[
    P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-k}
    \]
    where \( X \) is the number of successes, \( k \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n\} \), and \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient.

* **Example**:
  - In a series of 10 coin tosses, what is the probability of getting exactly 6 heads (successes)? Here, \( n = 10 \) and \( p = 0.5 \).

* **Properties**:
  - **Mean** (Expected Value): \( \mu = n \cdot p \)
  - **Variance**: \( \sigma^2 = n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p) \)

#### [Poisson Distribution](#poisson-distribution)
* The **Poisson distribution** models the number of times an event occurs within a fixed interval of time or space, given that the events occur independently and at a constant average rate.

* **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Parameter** \( \lambda \): The average rate of occurrence of the event within a fixed interval.
  - The number of occurrences is modeled as a random variable \( X \), and it can take values \( k = 0, 1, 2, \dots \).

* **Formula**:
  - Probability mass function (PMF):
    \[
    P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
    \]
    where \( \lambda \) is the expected number of occurrences, and \( k \) is the actual number of occurrences.

* **Example**:
  - The average number of emails received per hour is 5. What is the probability of receiving exactly 3 emails in an hour?

* **Properties**:
  - **Mean**: \( \mu = \lambda \)
  - **Variance**: \( \sigma^2 = \lambda \)

### Continuous Probability Distributions
#### [Uniform Distribution](#uniform-distribution)
* The **Uniform distribution** is a type of continuous probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely within a given range. The distribution is defined by two parameters: the minimum and maximum values.

* **Formula**:
  - Probability density function (PDF):
    \[
    f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}, \quad \text{for} \, a \leq x \leq b
    \]
    where \( a \) and \( b \) are the minimum and maximum values of the range.

* **Example**:
  - Rolling a fair 6-sided die. Each outcome is equally likely, so the distribution is uniform over the range \( [1, 6] \).

#### [Normal (Gaussian) Distribution](#normal-gaussian-distribution)
* The **Normal distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian distribution**, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean. It is one of the most commonly used distributions in statistics.

* **Formula**:
  - Probability density function (PDF):
    \[
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
    \]
    where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

* **Properties**:
  - Symmetrical: The distribution is symmetrical around the mean.
  - **Mean** = \( \mu \)
  - **Variance** = \( \sigma^2 \)

[Back to [Continuous Probability Distributions]](#continuous-probability-distributions) | [Back to Probability Distributions](#probability-distributions)

#### [Exponential Distribution](#exponential-distribution)
* The **Exponential distribution** models the time between events in a Poisson process. It is a continuous distribution with a constant hazard rate.

* **Formula**:
  - Probability density function (PDF):
    \[
    f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
    \]
    where \( \lambda \) is the rate parameter.

* **Example**:
  - The time between arrivals of customers at a service desk follows an exponential distribution.

#### [Student’s t-Distribution](#students-t-distribution)
* The **t-distribution** is used in hypothesis testing, particularly in small sample sizes when the population variance is unknown.

* **Formula**:
  - Probability density function (PDF):
    \[
    f(x) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\nu \pi} \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu + 1}{2}}
    \]
    where \( \nu \) is the degrees of freedom.
