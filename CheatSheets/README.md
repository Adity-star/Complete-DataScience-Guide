# Data Science Cheatsheets

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves two main purposes:
1. Help Data Science Practitioners Prepare for Interviews.
2. Introduce Data Science Concepts to Beginners.

## Probability Distributions
A probability distribution specifies the relative likelihood of all possible outcomes for a given random variable.
1. Discrete Random Variables
For a discrete random variable 
ùë•
x, the probability distribution is represented by a probability mass function (PMF), denoted as 
ùëì
(
ùë•
)
f(x). This function provides the probability of each possible value of 
ùë•
x. In other words, it tells you how likely it is that the random variable will take a particular value.
